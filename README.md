You can interact with the app here:

## Side Note
There are plenty of things I can improve.  
Notice that I only pulled the Vancouver average Snow and Temperature measures from the database.  
I can make a drop-down menu for users to choose a specific Province/City, then use `grep` to filter a sub data frame for that.  
Also, users should be able to switch to some other databases of their choices, like the Canada Min/Max Temperature database.  
I will be updating this Shiny App, if I have timeâ€¦
